#Batch OS: 
	- [x] This type of OS do not interact with the computer directly. There is an operator which takes similar job having same requirement and group them into batches. It is the responsibility of operator to sort the jobs with similar needs.
	- [x] Advantages:
		-	Processor of the batch systems knows how long the job would be when it is in queue
		-	Multiple users can share the batch systems
		-	The idle time batch system is very less
		-	Easy to manage large work repeatedly in batch systems
	- [x] Disadvantages:
		-	Hard to debug
		-	Costly
		-	The other jobs will have to wait for an unknown time if any job fails
#Time-Sharing OS:
	- [x] Each task has given some time to execute, so that all the tasks work smoothly. Each user gets time of CPU as they use single system. These systems are also known as Multitasking Systems. The task can be from single user or from different user also. The time that each task gets to execute is called quantum. After this time interval is over OS switches over to next task.
	- [x] Advantages:
		-	Each task gets an equal opportunity
		-	Less chances of duplication of software
		-	CPU idle time can be reduced
#Distributed OS:
	- [x] Various autonomous interconnected computers communicate each other using a shared communication network. Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU. These are referred as loosely coupled systems or distributed systems. These systems processors differ in sizes and functions. The major benefit of working with these types of operating system is that it is always possible that one user can access the files of software which are not actually present on his system but on some other system connected within this networkk, remote access is enabled within the devices connected in that network
#Network OS:
	- [x] Runs  on a server and provides the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions. These type of operating systems allows shared access of files, printer, security, applications, and other networking functions over a small private network. One more important aspect of Network OS is that all the users are well aware of the underiying configuration, of all other users within the network, their individual connections
